#### Any issues with radar data not properly distributed to VT/USASK/BAS. From Simon: 
1. What is the purpose of 'holding' institutions? Do they add anything, other than another
point of failure and overly complicating the system?
1. Why are data from some radars distributed to both servers (are they?) but not all?
1. Do we want additional servers and which data do they get?
1. How can we reduce manual processes necessary to keep things running properly (data flow 
and synchronization between servers?)

#### Mirror sync issues
1. Evan has produced lists of files
    1. Files that are on Globus, but not at BAS
    1. Files that are at BAS, but not Globus
    1. Files
 
#### Metadata/context for removed files
 
#### How do we ensure that corrected data is distributed through PI institutions? 

## Data Issues

#### `dattorawacf` concerns: Evan brought up the issue and his description is below:
```
I've just spot checked a random UNW rawacf file (20120217.1400.00.unw.rawacf) from the BAS 
mirror and compared the dmapdump contents to the output of a dattorawacf command using the 
original dat file on VT's server. As expected, the slist parameter (indicating the ranges 
with valid data) is smaller for the VT-produced rawacf files when compared to the new 
rawacf file produced with a dattorawacf command.  This is because, as previously noted, 
there was a low power thresholding issue which was only recently fixed in the dattorawacf 
conversion routine which caused some ranges to be dropped from the rawacf file.

I also noticed the time of the first record in this particular file (14:01:24 UT) does 
not match the time as suggested from the filename (14:00:00 UT).  So I think we need to 
reprocess all of these dat files with the updated dattorawacf command (with the low-power 
thresholding disabled) and a more rigorous file naming extraction based on the first timestamp."

I was just trying to track down a few rogue CPIDs from Stokkseyri and noticed some January 
2009 RAWACF files were also produced using a dattorawacf command with low-power 
thresholding enabled (eg, 20090104.0000.00.sto.rawacf.bz2):

         string  "origin.command" = "/home/dproc/bin/dattorawacf /data1/tmp/tmp.T30861"
         ...
         string  "combf" = "$Id: fast_fte.c,v 1.01 2004/10/10 11:55:01 J.P. Villain$"
         float   "thr" = 3.000000

I'm guessing this is when the site was still using RADOPS2000 and just before the hardware 
and electronics were upgraded/replaced in 2010.  So the rawacf files from Stokkseyri for 
July 2006 to January 2009 may also need reprocessing if possible.  Would anyone still 
have the original dat files from these dates?
```
