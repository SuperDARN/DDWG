## Purpose

This WG is charged with maintaining the protocols for transferring Level 1 data 
files from PI institutions, first to holding institutions and 
ultimately to distribution institutions where they are merged, checked, catalogued and copied to 
servers for community access. 

## Holding Institution(s)

The holding institution prior to October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2013 was JHU/APL. See Appendix A 
for a description of the system that was in place at JHU/APL.

The holding institution beginning October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2013 is Virginia Tech. 
See Appendix B for a description of the system in place at Virginia Tech.

An additional holding institution was put in place in 2016 at BAS, and the official 
announcement was made on January 24 2017. Note that BAS is also a distribution institution.

## Distribution Institution(s)

The distribution institutions are currently USASK and BAS. See Appendix C for a description
of the current system in place at USASK, and a brief description of the 
previous system. See Appendix D for a description of the current system in place at BAS.

## Membership

The membership of the working group consists of several types of members:

1. The chair or co-chairs
2. Those responsible for providing data to the holding institution(s)
3. Those responsible for accessing data from data mirrors to download to their institution.
4. Others who wish to observe.

The current membership includes:

## Communications

Communication shall primarily be done over email via the DDWG mailing list set up by Nozomu Nishitani,
maintained at Nagoya University. To send email to the list, send mail to <darn-ddwg@isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp>.
Previously, a mailing list set up by Julian Thornhill, maintained by Leicester University, was used. 
That list address was <darn-ddwg@ion.le.ac.uk>.

A person wishing to subscribe to the DDWG emailing list should contact the Chair 
(or co-Chairs) or the current PI institution’s member about subscribing to this list. 
Subscribing to the list should be only at the approval of the Chair (or co-Chairs) so that they 
are aware of an addition or change within a PI institution.

## Responsibilities

Chair/Co-Chair: Provide updates on the status of the SuperDARN data distribution system to the 
members of the DDWG. Operate and maintain the SuperDARN holding and Distribution institution 
systems. Track down gaps in data and resolve them, either by providing an explanation for why 
the data is missing, or retrieving it from the PI institution responsible if it is not a real gap.

Members responsible for providing data to the holding institution: Provide data in a timely and 
preferably automated manner to the holding institution(s), either by 'pushing' the data or by 
placing it in a holding area for the holding institution to 'pull'. 
Help with gap resolution when requested.

Members responsible for accessing data from mirrors: Set up and maintain a way of downloading 
data from the mirrors in a timely fashion for their PI institution. 
Provide feedback on the mirror setup.

Observers: Provide feedback or input on discussions.

## Raising Issues

Anyone can raise issues to the DDWG. The order of preference for raising issues is:
 1. Via the github repository here: <https://github.com/SuperDARN/DDWG/issues/new/choose>
 2. Via an email to the DDWG mailing list: <darn-ddwg@isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp>
 3. Via an email to the chair or co-chair(s)
