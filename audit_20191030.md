# Data Management Audit - October 30 2019

A series of questions was emailed out to members of the DDWG on October 30, 2019.
They email sent is reproduced here:
```
At SuperDARN Canada we're working to improve the management of data 
distribution, therefore as chair of the Data Distribution Working Group, 
I'm doing a review of the current status.
To that end, I have a few questions for you to help us gather 
information about what SuperDARNers are currently doing, and if things 
can be improved upon.

Would you mind taking a few minutes to help by answering the following 
questions? Get as detailed as you want, I'll gladly read your response:

1) Where do you get your data from and why? (BAS, Usask, other?) Do you 
only download/sync rawacf, or other products as well? 
2) How often do you sync data? What method do you use? (rsync, sftp, 
other?) Do you use a crontask or other automated method?
3) Do you store all the rawacf data locally or do you download, process 
to fitacf (or other secondary products) and remove it? Would you just 
download fitacfs if they were available?
4) What software (and version) do you use to process SuperDARN files? 
(RST, STK, GO, other?)
5) Does the current data distribution system work well for you? Are you 
satisfied?
6) Any other general comments or suggestions you would like to make?
```

A digest of the responses:

Some common responses to questions 1 and 2 revealed that some institutions are using rsync to
download RAWACF, some are not downloading at all, and only a few are automating this
synchronization. Common responses to question 3 show that many institutions would rather download
prepared FITACF files instead of RAWACF, with one exception indicating that there are still too many
problems with fitting techniques. Responses to question 4 indicate that a centralized, supported
software package is sought after, and everyone seems to use a variety of different software packages
with different versions to process their SuperDARN data. Responses to question 5 and 6 were mostly
positive, with one exception indicating that data persistence should be a concern (prompted by the data
loss with Compute Canada in 2018) and that the two main sources of data (BAS and USASK) need to be
improved with respect to consistency.
