## General Announcements - 10 minutes

1. Kevin Sterne: VT Will have an extended outage (maybe a day or week or longer) 
sometime this summer.
1. DDWG Github repository will now be used to keep track of DDWG tasks, issues, etc.
1. hdw.dat files are not within the scope of DDWG
1. Activities over the past year
    1. Sessai and Yuka found many DAT files from 1999 (it was suspected they were missed because 
    they had a non-standard name, the first two digits of the year were missing)
    1. Evan found that some DAT files that were listed as missing actually just had differing 
    case on some characters, and these files were retrieved from VT's archive
    1. Judy uploaded many SAN DAT files from 1999
    1. Blacklisted/removed files made available via Globus 'deletions' directory
    1. Compute Canada allocation awarded, we now have 85TB (then 90 and 95 TB the next two years)
    1. Audit performed, thank you for your feedback
    1. FITACF 3.0 files available on request via Globus 
    1. Data gaps for September 2017 to August 2019 checked
    1. Evan uncovered an issue with DAT hashes files that was fixed by Kevin
    1. New radars added to the distribution: DCN and JME
    1. Evan and Paul worked to fill in some gaps of data on the BAS server

## DDWG Discussion topics

#### Charter update and review - 30 minutes
1. Review scope & purpose of DDWG (keeping in mind DAWG and DSWG)
1. Review communications channels
1. Review responsibilities of members/observers/chairs or co-chair(s)
1. Review types of members

#### Policies update and review - 30 minutes
1. Raising issues
1. Blacklisting files
1. Checking files
1. Updating files
1. Addition of old files
1. Removing files
1. Record-keeping/backups
1. Gap resolution
1. Reporting

#### Any issues with radar data not properly distributed to VT/USASK/BAS - 30 minutes 
From Simon: 
1. What is the purpose of 'holding' institutions? Do they add anything, other than another
point of failure and overly complicating the system?
1. Why are data from some radars distributed to both servers (are they?) but not all?
1. Do we want additional servers and which data do they get?
1. How can we reduce manual processes necessary to keep things running properly (data flow 
and synchronization between servers?)

~ Good time for a break ~

#### Mirror sync issues - 30 minutes
1. Evan has produced lists of files (20200521)
    1. Files that are on Globus, but not at BAS (~11,400)
    1. Files that are at BAS, but not Globus (~800 files)

#### Metadata/context for removed files - 10 minutes
1. Federica brought up a suggestion, regarding the blacklisted/removed files that are 
now available on Globus in a parallel directory to the main distribution, as of August 20 2019.
```
I’m wondering if it could be useful that a bit of information on why the data 
are there is made available as well (or perhaps to explicitly indicate, in some way,
to contact the PI for further information in case one is particularly keen on using
those data). Not sure, however, how this can be realized
```

#### How do we ensure that corrected data is distributed through PI institutions?  - 10 minutes

Currently, when corrected files are placed on the mirror, the policy is to inform
the DDWG through the mailing list, and to suggest that any higher level data products need to 
be reproduced. There is no feedback loop here to know that this is actually happening.

Is this an issue? How do we ensure that everyone is up-to-date?

## Data Issues

#### `dattorawacf` concerns - 10 minutes

Evan brought up this issue and his description is below. In summary, the `dattorawacf` 
program has been updated (see [this](https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst/issues/142)), and any 
files that were processed from DAT to RAWACF with the old version need to be reproduced 
with the new version. However, those original DAT files (UNW and STO) still need to be found.

```
I've just spot checked a random UNW rawacf file (20120217.1400.00.unw.rawacf) from the BAS 
mirror and compared the dmapdump contents to the output of a dattorawacf command using the 
original dat file on VT's server. As expected, the slist parameter (indicating the ranges 
with valid data) is smaller for the VT-produced rawacf files when compared to the new 
rawacf file produced with a dattorawacf command.  This is because, as previously noted, 
there was a low power thresholding issue which was only recently fixed in the dattorawacf 
conversion routine which caused some ranges to be dropped from the rawacf file.

I also noticed the time of the first record in this particular file (14:01:24 UT) does 
not match the time as suggested from the filename (14:00:00 UT).  So I think we need to 
reprocess all of these dat files with the updated dattorawacf command (with the low-power 
thresholding disabled) and a more rigorous file naming extraction based on the first timestamp."

I was just trying to track down a few rogue CPIDs from Stokkseyri and noticed some January 
2009 RAWACF files were also produced using a dattorawacf command with low-power 
thresholding enabled (eg, 20090104.0000.00.sto.rawacf.bz2):

         string  "origin.command" = "/home/dproc/bin/dattorawacf /data1/tmp/tmp.T30861"
         ...
         string  "combf" = "$Id: fast_fte.c,v 1.01 2004/10/10 11:55:01 J.P. Villain$"
         float   "thr" = 3.000000

I'm guessing this is when the site was still using RADOPS2000 and just before the hardware 
and electronics were upgraded/replaced in 2010.  So the rawacf files from Stokkseyri for 
July 2006 to January 2009 may also need reprocessing if possible.  Would anyone still 
have the original dat files from these dates?
```
