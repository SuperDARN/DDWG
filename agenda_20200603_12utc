The current agenda for the annual workshop DDWG meeting on June 3rd at 12:00 UTC is:

 - Github DDWG repository
 
 - dattorawacf concerns:
 Evan brought up the issue and described it:
 "
I've just spot checked a random UNW rawacf file (20120217.1400.00.unw.rawacf) from the BAS mirror and compared the
dmapdump contents to the output of a dattorawacf command using the original dat file on VT's server.  
As expected, the slist parameter (indicating the ranges with valid data) is smaller for the VT-produced rawacf 
files when compared to the new rawacf file produced with a dattorawacf command.  This is because, as 
previously noted, there was a low power thresholding issue which was only recently fixed in the dattorawacf 
conversion routine which caused some ranges to be dropped from the rawacf file.

I also noticed the time of the first record in this particular file (14:01:24 UT) does not match the time as 
suggested from the filename (14:00:00 UT).  So I think we need to reprocess all of these dat files with the 
updated dattorawacf command (with the low-power thresholding disabled) and a more rigorous file naming extraction 
based on the first timestamp."

"I was just trying to track down a few rogue CPIDs from Stokkseyri and noticed some January 2009 RAWACF files
 were also produced using a dattorawacf command with low-power thresholding enabled (eg, 20090104.0000.00.sto.rawacf.bz2):

         string  "origin.command" = "/home/dproc/bin/dattorawacf /data1/tmp/tmp.T30861"
         ...
         string  "combf" = "$Id: fast_fte.c,v 1.01 2004/10/10 11:55:01 J.P. Villain$"
         float   "thr" = 3.000000


I'm guessing this is when the site was still using RADOPS2000 and just before the hardware and electronics were
upgraded/replaced in 2010.  So the rawacf files from Stokkseyri for July 2006 to January 2009 may also need 
reprocessing if possible.  Would anyone still have the original dat files from these dates?"
 
 - Charter update
 
 - Mirror sync issues
 
 - Metadata/context for removed files
 
 - Any issues with radar data not properly distributed to VT/USASK/BAS:
 From Simon: "What is the purpose of "holding" institutions? Do they add anything, other than another point 
 of failure and overly complicating the system? Why are data from some radars distributed to both servers 
 (are they?) but not all? Do we want additional servers and which data do they get? How can we reduce manual 
 processes necessary to keep things running properly (data flow and synchronization between servers) 
 There are lots of questions regarding the state of the system and how we can realistically improve it.
 You will note that I have stopped using the term "mirror". In order to move toward a "mirror" system we need 
 to use common protocols. At least I think we do..."
 
 - How do we ensure that corrected data is distributed through PI institutions?
