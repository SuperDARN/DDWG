## Issues Encountered
* Power outage at USASK caused server failure, resulting in brief transfer delay for CDN files to 
BAS/VT/Globus in April 

## Help requested
PIs/Data managers please help with the following:

1. verify data gaps
1. connect with Paul Breen to transfer data to both BAS and VT
1. update the group and announce data distribution changes when they occur

## Outstanding Tasks & Future projects
* Upload past Borealis data to BAS/VT holding directories
as well as the Globus mirror.
* New Data mirrors?
